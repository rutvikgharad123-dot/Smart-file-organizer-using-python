# Smart-file-organizer-using-python
Built a Smart File Organizer using Python to automatically sort and manage files based on their type, improving system organization and productivity.
Developed a Python-based automation tool that organizes unstructured files into well-defined folders based on file extensions such as documents, images, videos, and audio files. The system scans a selected directory (e.g., Downloads), identifies file types, creates required folders automatically, and moves files to their respective locations.

The project leverages Python’s os module for directory and path management and shutil for efficient file operations such as moving and organizing files. This solution reduces manual effort, improves file accessibility, and helps maintain a clean and structured file system.

This project demonstrates practical use of Python for automation, problem-solving, and real-world file management.
